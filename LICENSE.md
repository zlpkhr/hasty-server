One of the core principles of the GOFL is the recognition of the Author's contributions.

- **Preserving Author Credibility**: Any modifications or Derivative Works that substantially alter the functionality, design, or behavior of the Software must not misrepresent the original Author's contributions. You may add your own attribution, but you must clearly distinguish between your contributions and those of the original Author. Misrepresentation or failure to credit the Author appropriately may result in the termination of this license (see Section 9).
