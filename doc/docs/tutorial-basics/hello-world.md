## Hello World with Hasty Server

Hasty Server allows you to quickly set up a web server. Below is a simple example of how to create a "Hello World" server.

Example

Import Hasty Server

```js
const Hasty = require("hasty-server");
```

```js title="Create a new Hasty server instance"
const server = new Hasty();
```

```js title="Define a route for GET requests to the root URL"
server.get("/", (req, res) => {
  console.log("GET /");
  res.send("Hello, World!");
});
```

```js title="Start the server and listen on port 8080"
server.listen(8080, () => {
  console.log("Server listening on port 8080");
});
```

The code above sets up a basic server using the Hasty framework. When a `GET` request is made to the root (`/`) URL, it logs the request to the console and responds with "Hello, World!".

Running the Server
To run this server, save the above code in a file, for example, server.js, and then run the following command in your terminal:

```js title="Run the server"
$ node server.js
```

Open your browser and navigate to localhost:8080. You should see the "Hello, World!" message.
